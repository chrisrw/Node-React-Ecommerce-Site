# Node-React-Ecommerce-Site
An Ecommerce site created using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. Currently, I am just making a generic Ecommerce site that has "products" and "categories". Products and categories are software developer related but once this application is completed, I plan on refactoring it to reflect a more realistic Ecommerce application. 

## Back End (Node, Express, MongoDB)

Much of the back end is already developed in this application. Currently, products, categories, and users have full CRUD capabilities (tested through Postman). Authentication and authorization (including JWT) are also implemented. 

## Front End (React)

Currently, the front end is in its early stages of development. It will be more fleshed out by the end of the week (Friday April 10, 2020).
